# InfinityStreamer [Work In Progress]

InfinityStreamer is an open source project that aims to create and manage music livestreams, similar to those lo-fi livestreams that run 24/7 on YouTube. The app is built with a NestJS backend and a VueJS with Tailwind frontend.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple livestreams
- Handle multiple audio and video timelines
- Basic video editing functionality
- User authentication and authorization

## Current status:
- Base endpoints to create a stream (without integration with youtube or any other plataform), timelines and tracks. Also, we have the integration with the Upbeat API for fetching Tracks.
- UI is able to display the Streams and has the base for the Stream Editor, where is possible to render multiple timelines, add tracks from Upbeat and play/pause a AudioTimeline
